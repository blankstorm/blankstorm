# License

The licensed material and derivatives may NOT be used for any commerical purposes, distributed.

## Accounts

Individuals may create an account to play the Game. Accounts created are specific to individual who create them, and may not be sold or rented to anyone else. Accounts may be transferred as the licensors discretion.

## Modification

Modifications, tools, and plugins for the Game (collectively "Mod" or "Mods") may be created. "Mods" are any original content created that does not contain a significant part of the Game's code or content. When a Mod is added to the Game, the result is a "Modded" version of the Game.

Mods that are used to exploit any aspect of the Game are forbidden. Exploits include by not limited to gaining unauthorized access to parts of or information concerning the Game or the licensee, purposefully overusing resources, or attempting to "crash" or disable any part of the Game.

The licenser retains the right to determine what constitutes a "Mod".

## Fair Use

Within reason you're free to do whatever you want with screenshots and videos of the Game. By "within reason" we mean that you can't make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect our rights unless we've specifically said it's okay in this document, allowed it through the Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines, or provided for it in a specific agreement with you. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them. Also, please don't just take our content and pass it around as that's not fun.

Essentially the simple rule is do not make commercial use of anything we've made unless we've specifically said it's okay. Oh and if the law expressly allows it, such as under a "fair use" or fair dealing" doctrine then that's ok too - but only to the extent that the law applicable to you says so.

In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, we need all Game downloads and updates to come from an authorized source. It's also important for us that 3rd party tools/services don't seem "official" as we can't guarantee their quality. It's part of the responsibility we have to the users of our Game. Make sure that you read through our brand and asset usage guidelines too.

Although we give you permission to create an account and play our Game, we are still the owners of it. We are also the owners of our brands and any content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you create and account for our Game, you are getting the right to play and use our Game in accordance with this document - you are not getting the Game itself. The only permissions you have in connection with the Game and your usage of it are the permissions set out in this document.

Any Mods you create for the Game from scratch belong to you (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money or try to make money from them. Remember that a Mod means something that is your original work and that does not contain a substantial part of our code or content. You only own what you created; you do not own our code or content.

## Updates and Asset Usage

If you make any content available on or through our Game, you agree to give us permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you also agree to let us permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display your content. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving us and other users permission to use it. For example, we may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that you post on our website so others can read it. If you don't want to give us these permissions, do not make content available on or through our Game. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don't like.

If you are going to make something available on or through our Game, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using our Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

Any content you make available on our Game must also be your creation or you must have permission or the legal right to do it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the Game that infringes the rights of others.

We reserve the right to take down any content in our discretion.

We might make upgrades, updates or patches (we call them all "updates") available from time to time, but we don't have to. We are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. Of course, we hope to continue to release new updates for our Game, we just can't guarantee that we will do so. With updates come changes that might not work well with other software, such as Mods. This is unfortunate, but it is something we don't take responsibility for. If that is the case, please update your Mod.
