# License

## Accounts

Individuals may create an account to play the Game. Accounts created are specific to individual who create them, and may not be sold or rented to anyone else. Accounts may be transferred as the licensors discretion.

Although the licensor gives you permission to create an account and play the Game, they are still the owners of it. They are also the owners of any brands and content contained in the Game. Therefore, when you create and account for the Game, you are getting the right to play and use the Game in accordance with this document - you are not getting the Game itself. The only permissions you have in connection with the Game and your usage of it are the permissions set out in this document.

## Modification

Modifications, tools, and plugins for the Game (collectively "Mod" or "Mods") may be created. "Mods" are any original content created that does not contain a significant part of the Game's code or content. When a Mod is added to the Game, the result is a "Modded" version of the Game.

Mods that are used to exploit any aspect of the Game are forbidden. Exploits include by not limited to gaining unauthorized access to parts of or information concerning the Game or the licensee, purposefully overusing resources, or attempting to "crash" or disable any part of the Game.

The licenser retains the right to determine what constitutes a "Mod".

Any Mods you create for the Game from scratch belong to you (including pre-run Mods and in-memory Mods) and you can do whatever you want with them, as long as you don't sell them for money or try to make money from them. You only own what you created; you do not own the licensor's code or content.

## Fair Use and Asset Usage

The licensed material and derivatives may NOT be used for any commerical purposes. Within reason you're free to do whatever you want with records media of the Game (like screenshots and videos). "within reason" means that you can't make any commercial use of them or do things that are unfair or adversely affect the licensor's rights unless they have specifically said it's okay in this document or provided for it in a specific agreement with you. If you upload videos of the game to video sharing and streaming sites you are however allowed to put ads on them.

In order to ensure the integrity of the Game, all Game downloads and updates must come from an authorized source. It's also important that 3rd party tools/services don't seem "official" as their quality can't be guaranteed.

If you make any content available on or through the Game, you agree to give the licensor permission to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display that content. This permission is irrevocable, and you also agree to let the licensor permit other people to use, copy, modify, adapt, distribute, and publicly display your content. You are not giving up your ownership rights in your content, you are just giving the licensor and other users permission to use it. For example, they may need to copy, reformat, and distribute content that you post on a website so others can read it. If you don't want to give the licensor these permissions, do not make content available on or through the Game. Please think carefully before you make any content available, because it may be made public and might even be used by other people in a way you don't like.

If you are going to make something available on or through the Game, it must not be offensive to people or illegal, it must be honest, and it must be your own creation. Some examples of the types of things you must not make available using the Game include: posts that include racist or homophobic language; posts that are bullying or trolling; posts that are offensive or that damage our or another person's reputation; posts that include porn or someone else's creation or image; or posts that impersonate a moderator or try to trick or exploit people.

Any content you make available on the Game must also be your creation or you must have permission or the legal right to do it. You must not and you agree that you will not make any content available, using the Game that infringes the rights of others.

The licensor reserve's the right to take down any content at their discretion.

## Updates

The licensor might make upgrades, updates or patches (collectivly "updates") available from time to time, but they don't have to. they are also not obliged to provide ongoing support or maintenance of any Game. With updates come changes that might not work well with other software, such as Mods. This is unfortunate, but it is something the licensor does not take responsibility for.
